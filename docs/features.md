Trimmings offers many features for adding rich interaction to your static HTML. Most features are enabled by adding `data-trimmings-*` attributes to interactive elements like buttons and links. Some, like [Current]({{site.baseurl}}/features/current), listen for changes to the current page and add classes to specific elements automatically. Refer to the pages below for more details on each feature.
