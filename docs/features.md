Redact offers many features for adding rich interaction to your static HTML. Most features are enabled by adding `data-redact-*` attributes to interactive elements like buttons and links. Some, like [Current](/features/current), listen for changes to the current page and add classes to specific elements automatically. Refer to the pages below for more details on each feature.

[Autosubmit](/features/autosubmit): Submit your form automatically when a field changes.

[Current](/features/current): Style links to the current page automatically.

[Embed](/features/embed): Pre-fetch and replace links with the content they're linking to on page load.
