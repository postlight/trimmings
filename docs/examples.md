To help you start thinking about how to build rich user experiences with Trimmings, we provide the source code for a few web apps. All of these were written with Express.js, but keep in mind that that is irrelevant to Trimmingsâ€”it just wants HTML, and it doesn't care how it gets into the browser.

<h2>

    Fotogram
  </a>
</h2>

A clone of the web version of a ubiquitous photo-sharing social network. Modals, carousels, keyboard shortcuts. Try commenting on a photo, and then try to submit the comment form without typing anything. As an exercise for you, how might this app be modified to provide inline form validation errors?

    Mailbin
  </a>
</h2>

An email client. Try it on a desktop-sized screen and a mobile-sized screen!
