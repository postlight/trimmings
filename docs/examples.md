To help you start thinking about how to build rich user experiences with Trim, we provide the source code for a few web apps. All of these were written with Express.js, but keep in mind that that is irrelevant to Trimâ€”it just wants HTML, and it doesn't care how it gets into the browser.

## Social Photos

A clone of the web version of a ubiquitous photo-sharing social network. Modals, carousels, keyboard shortcuts. Try commenting on a photo, and then try to submit the comment form without typing anything. As an exercise for you, how might this app be modified to provide inline form validation errors?

## Email

An email client. Try it on a desktop-sized screen and a mobile-sized screen!

## Vocabulary

A streamlined card UI. Designed for small handheld screens, but loaded with keyboard shortcuts too!
